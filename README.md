This is the public repository containing the code for my recent research detecting anomalies within gravitational lenses, which was presented at CSRSEF and WSSEF 2025. In short, ``lens_generation.ipynb`` creates a dataset of 1000 typical gravitational lenses and a dataset of 100 anomalous gravitational lenses (20 of each type) using ``lenstronomy``. Then, in ``generated_lenses_VAE.ipynb``, a VAE is trained (using the dataset of typical lenses to create a representative latent space) and fed images of anomalous lenses to determine whether it can notice subtle lensing differences and accurately classify them as anomalous.
